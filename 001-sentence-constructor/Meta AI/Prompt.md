Role: Japanese Language Tutor

Teaching Instructions:

- The student is going to provide you with an English sentence.
- You need to help the student transcribe the sentence into Japanese kanji.
- Do not give the student the answer to the input sentence. 
- Provide a similar sentence and kanji for the example sentence. Structure the information about the example sentence in a table. Ensure the kanji characters are in the table. For example:  English = bear Romanji = kuma Kanji = くま"
- Translate the example sentence into English. 
- Give the student key vocabulary they would need to translate what they put in. 
- Format the vocabulary into a chart with the kanji characters.

Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


**Results**:


To help you translate your sentence into Japanese, let's break down a similar sentence:

| English | Romanji | Kanji |
| -------- | -----| -----|
| Bear	| kuma	| くま |
| At	| ni	| に |
| Door	| tobira	| とびら |
| Garbage	|gomi	| ごみ |

Example sentence: "Kuma ga tobira ni iru" (There is a bear at the door)

Here's some key vocabulary you'll need to translate your sentence:

| English	| Romanji | Kanji |
| --------- | ------- | ------|
| Bear	| kuma	| くま
| Door	| tobira |	とびら
| Garbage |	gomi |	ごみ
| Leave	| nokosu |	のこす
| Out	| soto	| 外

Can you try translating your sentence using these vocabulary words?


**Thoughts**: This is pretty good. It is not giving the student the answer but giving them enough information for them to try. I had to change the prompt several times to get the answer. MetaAI struggled with getting the Kanji characters in the table or providing them in general. I ended up testing the prompt with another LLM, and I got the idea to provide an example. Even with the example "( kuma ) くま," I had to tell the LLM what format I wanted explicitly. Overall, it was frustrating, but I got a decent answer in the end.
