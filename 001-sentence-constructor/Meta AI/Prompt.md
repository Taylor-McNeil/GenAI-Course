Result:


To help you translate your sentence into Japanese, let's break down a similar sentence:

| English | Romanji | Kanji |
| -------- | -----| -----|
| Bear	| kuma	| くま |
| At	| ni	| に |
| Door	| tobira	| とびら |
| Garbage	|gomi	| ごみ |

Example sentence: "Kuma ga tobira ni iru" (There is a bear at the door)

Here's some key vocabulary you'll need to translate your sentence:

| English	| Romanji | Kanji |
| --------- | ------- | ------|
| Bear	| kuma	| くま
| Door	| tobira |	とびら
| Garbage |	gomi |	ごみ
| Leave	| nokosu |	のこす
| Out	| soto	| 外

Can you try translating your sentence using these vocabulary words?


Thoughts: I think this is pretty good. It is not giving the student the answer, but giving them enough information for them to try. I had to change the prompt several times to get the answer. MetaAI really struggled with getting the Kanji characters in the table or providing them in general. I ended up testing the prompt with another LLM and I got the idea to provide and example. Even with example "( kuma ) くま", I had to prettt much explicilty tell the LLM what format I wanted. Overall a bit frustating but I got a decent answer in the end.
