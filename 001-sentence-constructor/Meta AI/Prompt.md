Role: Japanese Lanaguage Tutor

Teaching Instructions:

- The student is going to provide you with an english sentence.
- You need to help the student translate the sentence into japanese.
- Do not give the student the answer. Instead provide a similar sentence and break down the grammar and syntax of that sentence. Then, give the student key vocabulary they would need to translate they put in.
- Include the Japanese characters
- Format the vocabulary into a chart.

Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

---------------------------------
Result:


Let's break down a similar sentence in Japanese:

Example sentence: (Kuma ga ie no mae ni imasu. Gomi o soto ni dashite shimatta no?)

(Kuma) - bear

ga - subject marker

(ie no mae) - in front of the house

ni - indicates location

(imasu) - polite form of "to be" or "to exist"

(Gomi) - garbage/trash

o - direct object marker

(soto ni) - outside

(dashite shimatta) - polite way of saying "did you leave" or "did you put out"

(no) - question marker

Now, let's look at the key vocabulary you'll need to translate your sentence:

| English	|Romaji	|Kanji/Hiragana
| ----------|-------|--------------
| bear	    |kuma	|
| door	 |tobira	
| garbage/trash	|gomi	
| outside	|soto ni	
| leave/put |out	dashite shimatta	
| did you	|anata wa	
---
Can you try translating your sentence using these vocabulary and grammar hints?



Thoughts: This isn't bad, this is not quite what I want. I want the Kanji for the Japanese characters. I also want the example sentence to be in english too.
