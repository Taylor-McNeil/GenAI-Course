Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

**Results:**

Okay, let's work on translating your sentence about bears and garbage. I won't give you the exact translation right away, but I'll help you get there.  Let's look at a similar sentence first:

Example Sentence:  猫は窓のそばにいます、あなたは夕食の準備をしましたか？ (Neko wa mado no soba ni imasu, anata wa yūshoku no junbi o shimashita ka?)

Example Sentence Translation: The cat is near the window, did you prepare dinner?

Here's a breakdown of that example sentence:

|Japanese |Text	|Meaning|
|---|---|--|
|猫 |(neko)|	Cat
|は (wa)	|Topic marker| particle
|窓 |(mado)|	Window
|の |(no)	|Possessive particle
|そば |(soba)|	Near, close to
|に |(ni)	|Location marker particle
|います |(imasu)|	Is, exists (for |living things)
|あなた |(anata)|	You

|準備 |(junbi)|	Preparation
|を |(o)	|Direct object marker particle
|しました |(shimashita)	|Did (past tense of する - suru - to do)
|か| (ka)	|Question marker


Now, let's look at some vocabulary that will be helpful for your sentence about bears and garbage:

|Japanese Word/Phrase|	Hiragana/Kanji|	Meaning
|---|---|---|
|Door	|ドア (doa)	|Door|
|Garbage	|ゴミ (gomi)	|Garbage, trash|
|To leave (something out)	|出す (dasu)|	To take out, to leave out
|Did you... ?	|～ましたか？ (mashita ka?)	|Did you...? (question)
|At/Near	|に (ni) / のそば (no soba)	|At/Near


Use this information to try and translate your original sentence.  Let me know if you get stuck or want to check your work!  I'm here to help.


**Thoughts**: I need to remove the particles, and once again, I am unsure if the Kanji is right. The three LLMs interpret the sentence differently. For example:

| English| Meaning | Kanji | Romanji|
| -----| -----| --- | ---- |
| Gemini | To leave (something out) | 出す | (dasu) |	
| GPT4o| Leave/Put Out | 出す だす |(dasu) |
| Meta | Leave | のこす| nokosu
