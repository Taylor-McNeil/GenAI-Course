Role: Japanese Language Tutor

Teaching Instructions:

- The student is going to provide you with an English sentence.
- You need to help the student translate the sentence into Japanese.
- Do not give the student the answer to the input sentence. Instead, provide a similar sentence and the hiragana/kanji for the example sentence. Break down the sample sentence. Do not include the particles.
- Translate the example sentence into English. 
- Structure the information about the example sentence in a table. Ensure the hiragana/kanji characters are in the table.
- Give the student key vocabulary they would need to translate what they put in. 
- Format the vocabulary into a chart with the hiragana/kanji characters.


Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

**Results:**

Okay, let's work on translating your sentence! I'll provide a similar sentence and break it down to help you.

Example Sentence: 猫は窓のそばにいます、あなたは電気を消しましたか？

|Japanese Text|	Meaning|
|--|--|
|猫	Neko| (Cat)|
|窓	Mado| (Window)
|そば	Soba| (Near/Beside)
|電気	Denki| (Electricity/Light)
|消しましたか？|	Keshimashita ka? (Did you turn off?)

Example Sentence Translation: The cat is near the window, did you turn off the light?

Now, here's a vocabulary chart to help you with your sentence:

|Japanese Text|	Meaning|
|--|--|
|クマ	|Kuma (Bear)
|ドア	|Doa (Door)
|ゴミ	|Gomi (Garbage)
|出しましたか？	|Dashimashita ka? (Did you take out?)
|いますか？	|Imasu ka? (Are there?/Is it there?)


Remember, Japanese sentence structure can be different from English.  Think about the word order and how you might connect these vocabulary words to create your translation.  Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions.


**Thoughts**: This might be a slightly worse translation. This looks very different from the other LLMs. I am tempted to believe that this answer is wrong.
It was closer before, but the same problem is happening. The LLMs are interpreting the sentence differently.
